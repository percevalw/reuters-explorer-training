Reuters data explorer
=====================

The goal of this project is double:
- train an efficient reuters new article multi-label classifier
- get recommendations on read articles

The model is based on LSTM recurrent network and the recommendations are computed using proximity between learned DL representations. This repository contains the code used for the model training.

The web explorer code is hosted under another [repository](https://github.com/percevalw/reuters-explorer-website)

Check the Visualization notebook for more information about the trained model.
